Something something sometimes you need to roll a die to decide if a player succeeds or fails an something they are attempting to do. There are 3 common attempts:
 - [Attack roll](#Attack-roll)
 - [Check](#Check)
 - [Saving throw](#Saving-throw)
 To make an attempt, the player or the DM rolls 2d10, add the results of both dice together and add any modifiers to the roll. If the roll is greater or equal to the DC - the attempt was successful.
 
## Attack Roll
Attack rolls happen when a creature attempts to hit another creature with an attack.
Usually attack rolls will be calculated in the following way (unless specified otherwise):

> The roll sum + related ability modifier + proficiency (if proficient with the weapon used)

## Check
Checks are.... [something something]. Like in D&D, checks can be either:
 - Skill check: meaning there are special training which could improve the chances of a success, if  the creature has them. For most skills, there is an ability associated with them (for example - strength is associated with athletics). But players are encouraged to make skill checks in a way which plays to their own strength, according to the way a player describes their attempt- the DM can choose to let them add a different ability than the one which is usually associated with this skill.
 - Ability check: Ability checks are not related to any sort of training, but are affected by one's abilities. For example: Wisdom is an ability which can help when trying to decipher an unknown code.
 - General check: Sometimes, you just need luck and nothing else.

## Saving throw
Some harmful effects require a creature to make a saving throw to determined how they are affected by it. 


# Advantage and Disadvantage
Advantage & disadvantage are circumstantial effects.
If you have advantage, for each advantage you have - roll an additional d10. 
When calculating the sum of your roll- choose the highest 2 rolls. 
(Example - if you have an advantage of 3, roll 5d10, and add together the highest 2 rolls).

If you have disadvantage, for each disadvantage you have - roll an additional d10. When calculating the sum of your roll- choose the lowest 2 rolls. (Example - if you have a disadvantage of 3, roll 5d10, and add together the lowest 2 rolls).

Advantage & disadvantage can stack with one another, or cancel each other out.

Example: Vigo the ranger is ambushing a goblin scouting party. The goblins are surprised, so he has advantage on the attack roll. He is also hiding in the bushes, so he has another advantage. However- the goblins, however, are barely visible in the high brush, and enjoy half-cover, giving disadvantage to all attacks made against them. Totaling those circumstantial effects, Vigo has an advantage of 1 to the attack roll. So he rolls 3d10 and chooses the 2 highest numbers.

Example 2: Elijah is trying to resist the effect of a cursed ring. He needs to make a Wisdom saving throw. He has the exhausted status effect, giving him disadvantage on saving throws. However, the
