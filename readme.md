# Welcome to my experimental 2d10 ttrpg!

I’m trying to write a tabletop rpg based on D&D 5e, and I thought github will be a great place to collaborate with friends and strangers on this project.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is not just to create a new game for me and my friends, nor is it just to have a place to dump all my weird ideas about game mechanics. But to have a game that everyone with access to the internet can collaborate on, and every players group can fork to have their own homebrew version.

## How to Collaborate?

This whole project is written as .md files on a github. So you can either:

1.  You can edit right from within github buit-in text editor (but markdown files can be a bit annoying to edit).
2.  Clone this repo, and work on it offline using the plethora of markdown editing tools out there
3.  Do as I do, and edit directly from within github, but use [GitHub Writer plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-writer/diilnnhpcdjhhkjcbdljaonhmhapadap) (Which gives you the best editing experience possible)

## I Don’t Want to Collaborate

If you don’t want to collaborate, you can fork this repo to create your own private version!

## I Just Want to Look Around

If you just want to learn about the game, I recommend starting at the Table of Content \[Need to insert link\] or [How Rolls Are Made](How%20Rolls%20Are%20Made.md)
