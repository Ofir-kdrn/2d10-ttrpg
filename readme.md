<h1 id="welcome-to-my-experimental-2d10-ttrpg">Welcome to my experimental 2d10 ttrpg!</h1>
<p>I’m trying to write a tabletop rpg based on D&amp;D 5e, and I thought github will be a great place to collaborate with friends and strangers on this project.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is not just to create a new game for me and my friends, nor is it just to have a place to dump all my weird ideas about game mechanics. But to have a game that everyone with access to the internet can collaborate on, and every players group can fork to have their own homebrew version.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-collaborate">How to Collaborate?</h2>
<p>This whole project is written as .md files on a github. So you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone this repo, and work on it offline using the plethora of markdown editing tools out there</li>
<li>Do as I do, and link you github account to <a href="https://stackedit.io/app#">Stackedit</a><br>
Once you’ve made any edits, you can just create a pull request!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="i-dont-want-to-collaborate">I Don’t Want to Collaborate</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to collaborate, you can fork this repo to create your own private version!</p>
<h2 id="i-just-want-to-look-around">I Just Want to Look Around</h2>
<p>If you just want to learn about the game, I recommend starting at the Table of Content [Need to insert link] or <a href="How-Rolls-Are-Made.md">How Rolls Are Made</a></p>
