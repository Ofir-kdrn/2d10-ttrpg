If you are reduced to 0 HP or lower, you go unconscious and start bleeding to death.Â 

When you lose consciousness in combat, you automatically move your initiative to be before the current turn.

If you accumulate 3 successful death saving throws - you are stabilized.

If you accumulate 3 failed death saving throws - you bleed out and die.

Taking damage while unconscious causes you to lose a death save, if the damage is due to a critical hit, it counts as 2 failed death saves.

If you are healed while unconscious, you regain consciousness but suffer one point of exhaustion.

A stabilized creature goes back to 1HP after 10 minutes, and doesn't suffer exhaustion.

## Massive damage

You die instantly if you ever take damage equal to or greater than double your maximum Hit Points in one blow.
