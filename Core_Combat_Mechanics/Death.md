If you are reduced to 0 HP or lower, you go unconscious and start bleeding to death. You keep tracking your hit points even if the drop below 0.

If you are ever reduced to half your max HP below zero - you die.

While bleeding to death you make death saving throws, similarly to 5e.

If you accumulate 3 successful death saving throws - you are stabilized (but can still die if you HP drops to half your max HP below zero).

If you accumulate 3 failed death saving throws - you bleed out and die.

Taking damage while unconscious doesn't affect your death saving throws. But if you were stabilized you start bleeding again. Any previous death saving throws success or fails are cleared.

If you are healed while unconscious you are automatically stabilized. If the healing is enough to bring you above 0 HP, you regain consciousness but suffer one point of exhaustion.

A stabilized creature goes back to 1HP after 10 minutes, and doesn't suffer exhaustion.
