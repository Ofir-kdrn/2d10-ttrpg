<h1 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h1>
<ul>
<li>Work similarly to spell slots in D&amp;D 5e</li>
<li>You can cast spells using a higher level spell slot to make it more powerful in some way.</li>
<li>Spell slots are not easy to replenish</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h1>
<ul>
<li>Can be cast at 4 different forms (Lesser, Greater, Superior, Ultimate).</li>
<li>You can elevate a cantrip to a higher form by expending spell slots which total according to the table below</li>
<li>At level 5, you can cast any cantrip at its Greater form without expending spell slots</li>
<li>At level 11,  you can cast any cantrip at its Superior form without expending spell slots.</li>
<li>At level 17, you can cast any cantrip at its Ultimate form without expending spell slots</li>
<li>Depending on your level, you can cast cantrips of a certain form without expending a spell slot.</li>
</ul>

</table><p>For example: a 7th level Mage can cast the ultimate form of the Eldritch Blast cantrip by expending a single 3rd level spell slot, a 1st level spell slot and a 2nd level spell slot, or 3 1st level spell slots.</p>
<h1 id="rituals">Rituals</h1>
<ul>
<li>More spells will be rituals.</li>
<li>Spells which can be cast as rituals reduce the spell slot required to cast the spell</li>
<li>You donâ€™t have to know a spell in order to cast it as ritual, so long as you have access to a written form of the spell and have at least 1 level at a spell casting class.</li>
<li>Probably works kinda like this (the numbers represent the level of the spell slot expended):</li>
