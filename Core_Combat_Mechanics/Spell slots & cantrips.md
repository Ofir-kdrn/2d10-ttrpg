# Spell Slots

*   Work similarly to spell slots in D&D 5e
*   You can cast spells using a higher level spell slot to make it more powerful in some way.
*   Spell slots are not easy to replenish, and will usually only replenish themselves after a long rest (To encourage resource management between combats).

# Cantrips

*   Can be cast at 4 different forms (Lesser, Greater, Superior, Ultimate).
*   You can elevate a cantrip to a higher form by expending spell slots which total according to the table below
*   At level 5, you can cast any cantrip at its Greater form without expending spell slots
*   At level 11, you can cast any cantrip at its Superior form without expending spell slots.
*   At level 17, you can cast any cantrip at its Ultimate form without expending spell slots
*   Depending on your level, you can cast cantrips of a certain form without expending a spell slot.

| Lesser | Greater | Superior | Ultimate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \- | 1 SS | 2 SS | 3 SS |

For example: a 7th level Mage can cast the ultimate form of the Eldritch Blast cantrip by expending a single 3rd level spell slot, a 1st level spell slot and a 2nd level spell slot, or 3 1st level spell slots.

# Rituals

*   More spells will be rituals.
*   Spells which can be cast as rituals reduce the spell slot required to cast the spell
*   You donâ€™t have to know a spell in order to cast it as ritual, so long as you have access to a written form of the spell and have at least 1 level at a spell casting class.
*   Probably works kinda like this (the numbers represent the level of the spell slot expended):

| Ritual duration \\ Spell level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 minutes | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| 1 hour | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 8 hours | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 24 hours | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
