<p>Focus and Stance are mechanics similar to Concentration in D&amp;D 5e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each creature may only focus on one ability, and can only hold one stance at any given moment.</li>
<li>Being <a href="Staggered%20condition.md">staggered</a> or incapacitated makes you lose your focus and your stance.</li>
</ul>
