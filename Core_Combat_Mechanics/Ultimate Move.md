# Ultimate Move

*   Ultimate moves are very powerful, heroic abilities.
*   Ultimate moves have very specific conditions regarding when they can be used.
*   To regain a use of an ultimate move, it has to recharge. You roll for a recharge only at the end of your turn, (kinda like dragons breath). For example: Recharge d10(8-10).
*   Going out of combat does not recharge your ultimate move, you only roll for a recharge on combat turns (at the end of your turn).
