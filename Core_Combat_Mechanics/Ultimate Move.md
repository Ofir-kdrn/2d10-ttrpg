<h1 id="ultimate-move">Ultimate Move</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate moves are very powerful, heroic abilities.</li>
<li>Ultimate moves have very specific conditions regarding when they can be used.</li>
<li>To regain a use of an ultimate move, it has to recharge. You roll for a recharge only on combat turns (kinda like dragons breath). For example: Recharge d10(8-10).</li>
<li>Going out of combat does not recharge your ultimate move, you only roll for a recharge on combat turns (at the start of your turn).</li>
</ul>
