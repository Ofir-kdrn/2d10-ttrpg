<h1 id="staggered">Staggered</h1>
<p>If you take damage equals or greater than half your current HP - you must succeed on a CON save or be Staggered until the end of your next turn. Staggered works similarly to the Slow spell in 5e:</p>
<ul>
<li>You lose your current focus AND stance</li>
<li>Your move speed is halved.</li>
<li>You suffer a -2 penalty to your AC and DEX checks and saving throws.</li>
<li>You canâ€™t take any reactions.</li>
<li>On your turn, you may only use your action or bonus action, but not both.</li>
<li>You cannot attack more than once.</li>
<li>If you cast a spell using your action, it has a 50% chance to not go off until your next turn, and you need to use your action to complete it. Otherwise, the spell is wasted.</li>
</ul>
