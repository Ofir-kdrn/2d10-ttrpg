Assassins are really good at using the chaos of battle to their advantage or setting up a carefully planned ambush.  
 

## Sneak Attack

Once on your turn, when you hit a creature that is either surprised or can't see you with a weapon attack - you can add 1d8 to the damage roll.  
That damage increase as you gain levels in this class.

## Hiding in Plain Sight

You can use the chaos of battle  to your own advantage. When a creature you see makes an attack against a creature other than you, or is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to attempt to hide from that creature. You may move up to 10 feet to hide behind something such as furniture, terrain or even another creature that is your size or bigger.  
Make a Stealth check contested by the target creature's perception check, if your stealth roll is higher, you are hidden from that creature until the end of your next turn.
