# Rogue

Out of combat- rogues will have a lot of ways to succeed challenging skill checks in a reliable manner.

In combat, rogues should be strategic, and rely heavily on their team or catching their foes when the situation heavily favors them.

Rogues revolve around a mechanics called "Sneak attack". Every subclass has different conditions for their sneak attack, and different benefits those provide.

## 4th Level - Cloak and Dagger

When you hit a creature with a sneak attack with a melee weapon, you may forgo 1d8 points of damage from the sneak attack damage to move 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.

## 4th Level - Sharpshooter

When you make a ranged attack roll and have advantage on the roll, you may forgo 1 or more advantage points to deal an extra die of your sneak attack damage (1 die per advantage point) if you hit.
