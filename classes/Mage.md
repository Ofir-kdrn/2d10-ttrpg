The idea is to have mages as a completely (or almost completely) modular class. It doesn't have subclasses, but you can build them in vastly different ways.  
They start with a basic (but useful) spells list, and no (or very little) class abilities. They can take additional modules as they progress.

Mages 'modules' (yeah, we need a different name for those) may include stuff like:

*   Expanding your known spells lists (healing, necromancy, Summoning, Divination, Nature, Elemental, Protection, Crowd control, Enchantment are the examples we have right now)
*   Something like eldritch invocations
*   A specialized list of movement spells (with the special ability that they require your stance instead of focus). Ex. - Expeditious retreat, Levitate, Fly, \<blank>, far step. You still need to expend a spell slot to cast them.
*   buffed Mage armor (ac = 13+wis, +1 hp per level) which is permanently up.
*   Careful spell - When you cast a spell that has an area of effect, you can choose up to \<some number> of creatures, they gain advantage on their saving throw and if the succeed they take no damage (if they would take half damage).
*   \<something like> Divine intervention (requires- level 10)
*   Mayybe invoke duplicity
*   supped up Familiar
