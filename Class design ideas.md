<p>The main idea is to have classes balanced around a triangle with 3 major points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spellcasting</li>
<li>Abilities experts</li>
<li>Weapon fighting</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the class abilities will come from the <strong>subclass</strong>, while a few abilities will be inherited from the class. Classes and subclasses describe game mechanics which can be explained and flavored according to the player’s desire (For example - the Beast Master subclass can either be a ranger who is connected to the forest and nature, an inventor who uses constructs in combat, or a shaman who summons spirits to fight for him).</p>

<h2 id="warrior">Warrior</h2>
<p>Heavily relies on <a href="Core_Combat_Mechanics/Focus%20and%20Stance.md">Stances</a> and <a href="Core_Combat_Mechanics/Stamina%20points">Stamina points</a>. A warrior mainly uses weapons &amp; armor to be a mighty foe in combat. They get Extra attacks and add<br>
Warrior subclasses in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Master</li>
<li>Barbarian</li>
<li>Cavalier</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mage">Mage</h2>
<p>Mages rely heavily on spellcasting in their adventuring career. Most mages will prefer to stay away from the front lines and support their party with buffs, crowd control and ranged powerful spells. Mages rely heavily on maintaining a Focus and managing their Spell Slots - which represents the magical energy the expend when casting powerful spells.</p>
<p>Mages are unique in that they don’t have any subclasses. Instead they are built with modules [need to rename that]. And they gain a few extra feats with which they can enhance their spellcasting.</p>
<h2 id="rogue">Rogue</h2>
<p>Rogues are</p>
<h2 id="warmage">Warmage</h2>
<p>Warmages are experts in combining armed combat with spellcasting. Depending on the subclass, warmages might use any combination of spell slots, stamina points, Focus and Stances.<br>
Warmage subclasses in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleric (need to think of a better name)</li>
<li>Eldritch knight (actually more similar to the Paladin than the actual eldritch knight)</li>
<li>Bladesinger</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scout">Scout</h2>
<p>Scouts are light on their feet and and provide a lot of utility to any adventuring group.<br>
Subclasses in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beast Master</li>
<li>Monster Hunter (=5e ranger without magic)</li>
<li>Swashbuckler</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
